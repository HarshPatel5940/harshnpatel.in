# Go vs Node.js: Choosing the Right Backend Technology

When it comes to backend development, choosing the right technology stack can make or break your project. Two popular choices that often come up in discussions are **Go** (Golang) and **Node.js**. Both have their unique strengths and are backed by strong communities, but they serve different purposes and excel in different scenarios.

## Overview

### Go (Golang)
Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language developed by Google in 2009. It was designed to combine the efficiency of compiled languages with the ease of programming of interpreted languages.

### Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and has become one of the most popular backend technologies.

## Performance Comparison

### Execution Speed

**Go** wins in raw performance:
- **Compiled language**: Go compiles to native machine code
- **Static typing**: Enables compile-time optimizations
- **Garbage collector**: Efficient, low-latency GC designed for server applications
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines provide lightweight threading

```go

func processData(data []string) {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    for _, item := range data {
